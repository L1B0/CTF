See: http://www.comicbookmovie.com/agent_carter/is-the-agent-carter-one-shot-still-canon-a117930

Also:
The head-canon fan-theory I have is that the one-shot is actually a SHIELD propaganda film made by Howard Stark starring Peggy portraying herself in a condensed version of her rise from &quot;underdog female in the male-dominated workforce&quot; to &quot;head of SHIELD&quot;. Season 2 shows him getting into the film business, and Peggy, after becoming SHIELD's director, would likely realize there's a ton of potential young women looking for respectable and respectful work who her story could appeal to. So they make the film, quickly sum up her struggle without using any classified info from a real mission, change the names of all the real-life people who treated her bad (to be professional), fill it with engaging action, and WHAM, they've got a nice inspirational recruitment film for SHIELD.</t></text></comment></commentList></comments>
